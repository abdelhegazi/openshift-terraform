### openshift-terraform

This repo is to install and configure openshift on cloud 
I will do my best with AWS, Azure, GCE 

- as usual you need to define all your environment variabes to be able to access your own space on the specific cloud provider 
- I always use the latest version of terrafrom unless something is mentioned
- As of today this is terraform version I am using


- The architecture should be same nodes to be accessible via VPN server
